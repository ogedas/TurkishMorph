# Intro

This is a template for a visual lexical decision task using JSPsych. 

To run the experiment locally, create a local server in terminal from this folder. 

```
python -m http.server 
```

Copy the output address (e.g. `http://[::]:8000/`) into a local chrome browser. To view outputs, you can access the web developer tools with the hotkeys `cmd + shift + j` (mac).
